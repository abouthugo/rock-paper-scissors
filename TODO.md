## List of things that need to be completed for this assignment 

- [x] Choose a game: **Rock paper scissors (Stochastic)**
- [ ] Game requirements: **Hugo** 
    - [x] Create UI
    - [ ] Add socket io server
- [ ] List the following:
    - [ ] Initial State – indicates how the game is set up at start
    - [ ] Players – defines which player has a move in the state
    - [ ] Actions – returns the set of legal moves in a state
    - [ ] Results – determines the outcome of a move
    - [ ] Utility – gives the payoff with numeric values for each player
- [ ] Draw a game tree **LUIS**
     - analyze the performance of the players with utility values.
- [ ] State the evaluation functions wherever applicable
     - Use either Simple Minimax or Alpha Beta Pruning or Monte Carlo Simulation 
    > This analysis should be done by you in theory, and also implemented within the program wherever necessary with the goal of making a given player win
